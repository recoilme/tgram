# Tgram (medium clone on pure go)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Golang/Gin/Slowpoke** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more like realworld.io app

But now it self hosted project.

This app use [slowpoke](https://github.com/recoilme/slowpoke) as database. Package slowpoke implements a low-level key/value store in pure Go.
